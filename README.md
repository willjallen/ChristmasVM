# FunVM

This started as a challenege project to see how much of a VM I can put together while traveling on holidays.  

The model environment is a 16-bit, little-endian virtual machine. It is equipped to compile fun-lang (.funlang) to fun-asm (.funasm) and then to FVM bytecode (.fbc), which it may then execute.
