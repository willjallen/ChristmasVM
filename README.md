# ChristmasVM

This is a challenege project to see how much of a VM I can put together while traveling on holidays. I have never attempted this before, nor do I know what I am doing. 

The model environment is a 16-bit, little-endian virtual machine. It is equipped to compile cmas-lang (.cmas) to CVM bytecode (.cbc) and running that.
