The specification is as follows:

VM MODEL:
Registers:
REG\_A
REG\_B
REG\_C
REG\_PC
REG\_ACCUM

Memory:
MEMORY[addr]

CMAS LANGUAGE:

Types (they're all uint16\_t under the hood):
POINTER
BOOL
INT
UINT

Functions:
LABEL() -> POINTER
VAR(TYPE, NAME) -> POINTER
ADDRESSOF(NAME) -> POINTER
LOAD(ADDR) -> POINTER | BOOL | INT | UINT
STORE(NAME, ADDR)
JUMP(ADDR)
JUMPC(COND, ADDR)

Unary Operations:
!
++
-- 

Binary Operations
=
+
-
/

>>
<<
\*
/

Thoughts:
- No heap, no dynamic allocation
- Variables are stripped to addresses by compiler
